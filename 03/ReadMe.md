## What the Program Does
A program that reads a file from an IBM System/ 360-format floating point numbers and write them to a new file  in IEEE standard format. 


## Running the Program 

In the terminal type:

to compile:

```$javac IbmToIeee.java```

to run:

```$java IbmToIeee```

## Methods

The conversion between the two formats for all values gave a formula of 4(x) - 257 - 2^(e-1) where x is the decimal value of the exponent in the ibm form and e is the number of bits required for the precision of the ieee format. All 4 cases can be calculated with this formula as well as any bounds or limits. 

We found precision issues in the 32 bit ibm format when converting to the 32 bit ieee format. Values where the exponent was larger than 96 in base 10 would be out of range for the ieee and numbers less than 32 would also cause that. To over come these, output of infinity for values too large and 0 for values too small.
